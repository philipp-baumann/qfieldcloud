# QFieldCloud

QFieldCloud is a Django based service designed to synchronize projects and data between QGIS (+ QFieldSync plugin) and QField.

QFieldCloud allows seamless synchronization of your field data with your spatial infrastructure with change tracking, team management and online-offline work capabilities in QField.

# Hosted solution
If you're interested in quickly getting up and running, we suggest subscribing to the version hosted by OPENGIS.ch at https://qfield.cloud. This is also the instance that is integrated by default into QField.

## Documentation

QField and QFieldCloud documentation is deployed [here](https://docs.qfield.org).


## Development

### Clone the repository

Clone the repository and all its submodules:

    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:opengisch/qfieldcloud.git

To fetch upstream development, don't forget to update the submodules too:

    git pull --recurse-submodules  && git submodule update --recursive


### Launch a local instance

Copy the `.env.example` into `.env` file and configure it to your
desire with a good editor:

    cp .env.example .env
    emacs .env

To build development images and run the containers:

    docker compose up -d --build

It will read the `docker-compose*.yml` files specified in the `COMPOSE_FILE`
variable and start a django built-in server at `http://localhost:8011`.

Run the django database migrations.

    docker compose exec app python manage.py migrate

And collect the static files (CSS, JS etc):

    docker compose run app python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

You can check if everything seems to work correctly using the
`status` command:

    docker compose exec app python manage.py status

Now you can get started by adding the first user that would also be a super user:

    docker compose run app python manage.py createsuperuser --username super_user --email super@user.com

### Tests

To run all the unit and functional tests (on a throwaway test
database and a throwaway test storage directory):

    export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.override.local.yml:docker-compose.override.test.yml
    docker compose up -d
    docker compose run app python manage.py migrate
    docker compose run app python manage.py test --keepdb

To run only a test module (e.g. `test_permission.py`)

    docker compose run app python manage.py test qfieldcloud.core.tests.test_permission

### Debugging

> This section gives examples for VSCode, please adapt to your IDE)

If using the provided docker-compose overrides for developement, `debugpy` is installed.

You can debug interactively by adding this snipped anywhere in the code.
```python
import debugpy
debugpy.listen(("0.0.0.0", 5680))
print("debugpy waiting for debugger... üêõ")
debugpy.wait_for_client()  # optional
```

Or alternativley, prefix your commands with `python -m debugpy --listen 0.0.0.0:5680 --wait-for-client`.

    docker compose run app -p 5680:5680 python -m debugpy --listen 0.0.0.0:5680 --wait-for-client manage.py test
    docker compose run worker_wrapper -p 5681:5681 python -m debugpy --listen 0.0.0.0:5681 --wait-for-client manage.py test

Then, configure your IDE to connect (example given for VSCode's `.vscode/launch.json`, triggered with `F5`):
```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "QFC debug app",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "attach",
            "justMyCode": false,
            "connect": {"host": "localhost", "port": 5680},
            "pathMappings": [{
                "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/docker-app/qfieldcloud",
                "remoteRoot": "/usr/src/app/qfieldcloud"
            }]
        },
        {
            "name": "QFC debug worker_wrapper",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "attach",
            "justMyCode": false,
            "connect": {"host": "localhost", "port": 5681},
            "pathMappings": [{
                "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/docker-app/qfieldcloud",
                "remoteRoot": "/usr/src/app/qfieldcloud"
            }]
        }
    ]
}
```

Note if you run tests using the `docker-compose.test.yml` configuration, the `app` and `worker-wrapper` containers expose ports `5680` and `5681` respectively.


## Add root certificate

QFieldCloud will automatically generate a certificate and it's root certificate in `./config/nginx/certs`. However, you need to trust the root certificate first, so other programs (e.g. curl) can create secure connection to the local QFieldCloud instance.

On Debian/Ubuntu, copy the root certificate to the directory with trusted certificates. Note the extension has been changed to `.crt`:

    sudo cp ./conf/nginx/certs/rootCA.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/rootCA.crt

Trust the newly added certificate:

    sudo update-ca-certificates

Connecting with `curl` should return no errors:
    curl https://localhost:8002/

### Remove the root certificate

If you want to remove or change the root certificate, you need to remove the root certificate file and refresh the list of certificates:

    sudo rm /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/rootCA.crt
    sudo update-ca-certificates --fresh

Now connecting with `curl` should fail with a similar error:

    $ curl https://localhost:8002/

    curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
    More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

    curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
    establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
    how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.

### Code style

Code style done with precommit

    pip install pre-commit
    # install pre-commit hook
    pre-commit install


## Deployment


### Servers

QFieldCloud is published on two servers:

-   <https://dev.qfield.cloud/> This is a testing instance for new
    features.
-   <https://app.qfield.cloud/> This is the production instance. At
    the moment the deploy is done manually.

On the servers, we need only the `docker-compose.yml` and not the
"override" one. There are no mounted folders. To apply changes,
the docker image must be re-built.


### Launch a server instance

Copy the `.env.example` into `.env` file and configure it to your
desire with a good editor

    cp .env.example .env
    emacs .env

Do not forget to set DEBUG=0 and to adapt COMPOSE_FILE to not load local
development configurations.

Create the directory for qfieldcloud logs and supervisor socket file

    mkdir /var/local/qfieldcloud

Run and build the docker containers

    docker compose up -d --build

Run the django database migrations

    docker compose exec app python manage.py migrate


## Create a certificate using Let's Encrypt

If you are running the server on a server with a public domain, you can install Let's Encrypt certificate by running the following command:

    ./scripts/init_letsencrypt.sh

Note you may want to change the `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL`, `LETSENCRYPT_RSA_KEY_SIZE` and `LETSENCRYPT_STAGING` variables.

### Logs

Docker logs are managed by docker in the default way. To read the logs:

    docker compose logs


For great `nginx` logs, use:

    QFC_JQ='[.ts, .ip, (.method + " " + (.status|tostring) + " " + (.resp_time|tostring) + "s"), .uri, "I " + (.request_length|tostring) + " O " + (.resp_body_size|tostring), "C " + (.upstream_connect_time|tostring) + "s", "H " + (.upstream_header_time|tostring) + "s", "R " + (.upstream_response_time|tostring) + "s", .user_agent] | @tsv'
    docker compose logs nginx -f --no-log-prefix | grep ':"nginx"' | jq -r $QFC_JQ


### Geodb

The geodb (database for the users projects data) is installed on
separated machines (db1.qfield.cloud, db2.qfield.cloud, db3&#x2026;)
and they are load balanced and available through the
db.qfield.cloud address.

There is a template database called
`template_postgis` that is used to create the databases for the
users. The template db has the following extensions installed:

-   fuzzystrmatch
-   plpgsql
-   postgis
-   postgis<sub>tiger</sub><sub>geocoder</sub>
-   postgis<sub>topology</sub>

### Storage

You can use either the integrated `minio` object storage, or use an external provider (e. g. S3) with versioning enabled. Check the corresponding `STORAGE_*` environment variables for more info.
